# virtual-tourist
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

The application has two views to display the photos. First one is a collection view were users will be able to delete each photo by clicking on the photo. Also, user can reset the whole collection by clicking 'Reset Collection' button. On the other hand, the second view is a table view were users will be able to add one personal comment on each photo.
